# Playground
- **[TJBot Swift Playground](http://ibm.biz/tjbot-playground)** 
Follow the adventures of Tinker, the virtual TJBot, in his quest to transform into a real, live TJBot!  This is an interactive Swift Playground for iOS that allows you to program TJBot – both virtual and physical – in the Swift programming language. This playground does not require an actual TJBot to use, but if you would like to program your TJBot, it requires installation of the [TJBot Daemon](http://ibm.biz/tjbot-daemon) on your TJBot.
